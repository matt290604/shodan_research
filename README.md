# shodan_research
I originally planned to use it to write a master's thesis, but my professor thinks it is no use.
I admit it is a prototype, but just when I wanted to continue my research and do more,but my professor poured cold water on my head. So I gave up.
Now, I am like a normal person, upload this prototype to github, used to record it.

If you feel it useful, you can use it as much as possible. I also welcome to send a e-mail to me. I will continue to upgrade this program after receiving your suggestions.

I must say please indicate the source when you using it.
The most important thing is that this is for academic research, please do not use it for illegal or commercial activities.

Hope you have a nice day, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

How to use?

1. Download shodan search file, it is a json file
2. Input command : python3 shodan-parser.py -o <Output file name>.txt -v <Input file name>.json
3. Throw that file into EXCEL.

我本來想說把構想的程式先寫出來，讓我教授看一下這個原型，如果滿意或是需要修改，我在繼續往下研究。
但是我教授覺得我沒用，所以我就把這個程式放在這裡用來記錄。也順便學習怎麼使用github。

這個程式本來是用於分析shodan的josn檔案，首先下載你在shodan搜尋的檔案，他會是一個josn檔，之後只要輸入 
python3 shodan-parser.py -o <Output file name>.txt -v <Input file name>.json
然後再丟入excel

基本上python的搜尋規則都可以套用在shoda上面，除了CVE搜尋。目前我還沒找到直接搜尋CVE的方法。

這個程式本來的用途我也寫在ppt跟論文裡面。

祝各位使用愉快。
